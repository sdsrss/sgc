# /sgc:discover

When the user has an idea but the requirements are fuzzy. clarifier.discover emits ~20 forcing-questions so the user's answer can be dropped directly into `sgc plan --motivation`.

## Invocation

```bash
if   [ -f "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/bin/sgc.mjs" ]; then SGC="node $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/bin/sgc.mjs"
elif command -v sgc >/dev/null 2>&1;          then SGC=sgc
elif test -f src/sgc.ts;                      then SGC="bun src/sgc.ts"
else echo "sgc CLI not found — /plugin install sgc, or npm i -g @sdsrs/sgc, or https://github.com/sdsrss/sgc#install" >&2; exit 1
fi

$SGC discover "<vague topic>"
```

## What you should do

1. Capture the user's free-text topic (one phrase to one paragraph).
2. Run the CLI; surface the question groups.
3. Offer to capture the user's answers and re-format them as a single `--motivation` string for `/sgc:plan`.

## Notes

- `/discover` writes nothing — its output is hand-carried by the user into `/sgc:plan`.
- Currently an inline-stub agent (heuristic). Real-LLM version is on the H+1 roadmap.
- Pairs well with the `office-hours` skill from gstack (if installed) for the deeper brainstorm pass.
