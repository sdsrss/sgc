# /sgc:status

Quick "where am I" snapshot.

## Pre-flight

```bash
test -f src/sgc.ts || { printf "%s\n" "ERROR: sgc CLI not in current directory." "" "Install once per project (plugin layer is markdown-only; CLI is a separate clone):" "  git clone https://github.com/sdsrss/sgc && cd sgc" "  PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1 npm install" "" "Then re-run from the sgc/ directory." "See https://github.com/sdsrss/sgc#install for the canonical install reference." >&2; exit 1; }
```

## Invocation

```bash
bun src/sgc.ts status
```

## What you should do

1. Run the CLI verbatim.
2. If no `.sgc/` exists, suggest `/sgc:plan "<task>"` to bootstrap.
3. If active task is stale (last_activity > 24h ago), suggest reviewing `handoff.md` before resuming.

## Notes

- Permission row: `decisions:read:* / progress:read / solutions:read / reviews:read` — read-only across the board (`/status` has zero write capability).
